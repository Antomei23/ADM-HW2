Using AWS to run the code
We wrote a code in python that traces five most common tags in the file list.json. The code prints the table containing five most common tags and the number of times that each of them occur in the list.json file. After the table, our code shows the time of its execution.
When our code was finished, we launched an EC2 instance on AWS and used it to run our code again.
All the commands we used to acomplish running the code with EC2 instance are provided in our report that we finished by comparing the running time of our code with and without EC2.
